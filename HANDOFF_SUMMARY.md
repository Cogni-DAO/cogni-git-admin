# E2E Test Implementation Handoff

## Status: Basic E2E Pipeline Now Working (First Success!)

Just achieved first successful end-to-end test execution after fixing missing environment variable.

## What Just Got Fixed
- **Root Issue**: `COGNI_ALLOWED_DAO` was commented out in `.env` line 14
- **Result**: Uncommented → webhook processing now works
- **Evidence**: E2E test successfully processes blockchain events → GitHub operations
- **Good News**: This means our DAO address confirmation is working. Time to create a negative test.

## Current Working Components
- Admin plugin integration (`e2e/dao-merge.spec.ts`)
- Webhook processing with debug logging (`src/api/webhooks/onchain/cogni-signal/route.ts`)
- Environment configuration (`.env`)

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. HTTP Response Code Review ✅ RESOLVED
**File**: `src/api/webhooks/onchain/cogni-signal/route.ts`
**Issue**: ~~DAO validation failures return 204 instead of proper error codes~~ **FIXED**
**Solution**: 
- **422 Unprocessable Entity**: For DAO/chain validation failures with detailed error messages
- **400 Bad Request**: For unknown webhook providers
- **204 No Content**: Only for successfully processed webhooks with no relevant events

### 2. E2E Test Runner Integration  
**Files**: `e2e/e2e-runner.ts`, `package.json`
**Issue**: `npm run e2e` shows "1 test ran" - fixture replay doesn't count as test
**Options**: Remove e2e-runner.ts OR convert to Jest test format

## Key Files Modified
- `src/api/webhooks/onchain/cogni-signal/route.ts` - Added debug logging
- `e2e/dao-merge.spec.ts` - Fixed admin plugin ABI/permissions  
- `.env` - Uncommented `COGNI_ALLOWED_DAO` (critical fix)

This is MVP scaffolding - it works once but needs refinement.
