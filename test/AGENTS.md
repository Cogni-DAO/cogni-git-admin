# Test Infrastructure

Testing framework and utilities for the Cogni Git Admin application.

```

## Test Helpers

### Fixture Replay (`helpers/fixture-replay.ts`)
Replays captured webhook fixtures against running servers:
- Reads fixture files containing raw webhook data
- Reconstructs exact HTTP requests from captured metadata
- Sends replayed webhooks to specified target URLs
- Preserves original headers and raw body bytes (except Content-Length which is recalculated)
- Returns HTTP status code for verification
- Includes 10-second timeout for requests
- Provides debug logging for troubleshooting

#### Fixture Format Expected
```typescript
{
  headers: Record<string, string | string[]>;
  body_raw_base64: string;  // Base64-encoded raw bytes
  method: string;            // HTTP method
  url: string;               // Original request path
}
```

## Testing Workflow
1. Capture real webhooks using `tools/dev/webhook-capture/`
2. Store fixtures in `fixtures/` directory organized by provider
3. Use `fixture-replay.ts` to replay webhooks in tests
4. Verify application behavior with deterministic inputs

## Integration with Systems

### Capture System
Test fixtures are generated by the webhook capture tool (`tools/dev/webhook-capture/`) and organized by provider type. Fixtures contain exact webhook metadata including headers and base64-encoded raw body.

### E2E Testing
The fixture replay system is used by E2E tests (`e2e/webhook-e2e.test.ts`) to validate webhook processing against deployed applications. Currently provides MVP-level smoke testing with HTTP response validation only.

## Known Limitations
- Signature headers from original webhooks are preserved but not validated
- No support for HTTPS in fixture replay (HTTP only)
- Response bodies are consumed but not captured for analysis
