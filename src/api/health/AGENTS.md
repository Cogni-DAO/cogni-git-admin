# Health Check API

## Purpose
Application health and status monitoring endpoints.

## Scope
- GET `/api/v1/health` endpoint
- System status checks
- Dependency health validation

## Current Implementation
- **Empty**: No health endpoints implemented yet
- **Planned**: Basic health check with optional dependency checks

## Response Format
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "services": {
    "rpc": "healthy",
    "github": "healthy"
  }
}
```

## Guidelines
- Keep health checks lightweight
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 503)
- Include dependency status when possible
